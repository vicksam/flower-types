# Flower image classifier

In this project I build an image classifier to recognize flower types on images.

### Overview

I build and train the classifier using deep learning. Then I export the model to a simple command line application.

### Methods

* Deep learning

### Technologies

* Python
* TensorFlow

## How to use

*TODO*

## Dataset

The dataset for the project contains images of 102 flower species commonly occuring in the UK. It comes from [Oxford](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html).

#### Size

For each out of 102 flower types there are between 40 and 258 images.
